## Getting started

This project is a Javascript monorepo. To get started, you must first install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

> **Heads up ðŸ‘‹**
> Running `npm install` installs dependencies for the root `package.json` file, and _all_ `package.json` files in the `packages/` folder. You do not need to do this yourself.

### Development

To develop for this project, you can run:

```
npm run develop
```

Or to work on a specific package or unit of this monorepo, you can run:

```
npm run develop -- --scope @spike/package-name
```

Or to work on a set of specific packages or units of this monorepo, you can run:

```
npm run develop -- --scope @spike/package-name,npm run develop -- --scope @spike/package-name-2
```

> **Heads up ðŸ‘‹**
> The `develop` script starts the `develop` script of every package inside the `packages` folder, or for the scope specified.

### Production Builds

To create a production build of each package, you can run:

```
npm run build
```

> **Heads up ðŸ‘‹**
> The `build` script starts the `build` script of every package inside the `packages` folder, or for the scope specified, and runs them in the correct order for you!

### Releasing

We're not there yet, we're just an alpha project. Stay tuned!
